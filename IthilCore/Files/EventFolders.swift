/// - The folder is the source of truth for an event's files. Folders are created only by
///   `ensureFolder(for:)`, which the app calls when the first file arrives; lookups never create one.
/// - Every folder carries a marker, so a folder renamed (or moved to another day folder) in Finder is still
///   found. Markers are indexed by scanning `<root>/<yyyy-MM-dd>/*/.ithil-event`; `reindex()` rescans
///   everything. A lookup that misses refreshes only what changed since the last scan (judged by
///   modification dates): after a change in the root itself (day folders came or went), every day folder
///   that changed; otherwise just the occurrence's own day folder, if it changed. A stale entry (the
///   folder moved again) always refreshes. So a marked folder copied in while Ithil runs is found by the
///   next lookup when it lands in a new day folder or its own one, and anywhere after `reindex()`.
/// - Nothing is ever written outside the root: every create, write, move and trash checks `contains(_:)`
///   first (symbolic links resolved), so a link inside the root that points elsewhere is never written
///   through. Folders reached through such a link, and links in place of event folders, are ignored.
/// - Nothing is deleted permanently: event folders go to the Trash. The only removals are of folders
///   that are completely empty (a day folder left behind, or a folder this actor just made when writing
///   its marker failed), done with `rmdir`, which refuses a folder with anything in it. A trashed folder can
///   be put back where it belongs (`restoreFolder(from:for:)`), so Undo brings back an event's files too.
