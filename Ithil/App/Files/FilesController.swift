/// - The folder is the source of truth: counts and lists are read from disk on the `EventFolders` actor,

/// - Everything that changes the disk (copies, folder renames and moves, the Trash, a library move) runs
///   one at a time, in the order it was asked for, so a rename never races a copy into the same folder.
/// - Files are copied, never moved; folders and files go to the Trash, never deleted; nothing is written
///   outside the root. Folders are trashed only for occurrences the user deleted (after the UI asked).
/// - Undo and Redo (`LibraryChange.restored`) carry folders back along, and folders trashed in this session
///   come back from the Trash when their occurrences come back. A restore never trashes anything.
/// - Work started for one library is dropped when another one opens (`session`).
